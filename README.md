doesnt this look like someone you know over at where you are, whats his obsession, i dont get it


he's never going on a diet, that's a fact, he just cant do it, im confident about that much

im going to pass out laughing, jason has absolute bugs in his brain at this point

what went wrong in jasons life i dont get it, when i was there, a post doc said they had to wait an entire month to get an appointment to talk to him, and now his FULL TIME JOB is twitter and talking nonsense

are they in litigation against each other? thats his made up ... going to emphasize ... COMPLETELY MADE UP ... one-sided ... nemesis now is that whats going on, absolute BONKERS

so jason has been breaking everything left and right because hes not going to get what he one-sided wants so hes angry (and now miserable bc this has gone on for years) and also doesnt want to look stupid, [complete psycho lunatic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I66aySW4le8) i really dont know him, this is very insane, my brother is a huge fan of matt berry, he was on community and he played a grifter professor who taught "Grifting 101" lol

the whole thing is very weird, its an adult 50+ year old juvenile that just never grew up, absolute nuisance ðŸ¤¡
